ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C 'your email' // provide email as a label

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"   // start the ssh-agent

ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa    // -k only for mac. key, not certificate

    using ssh-add, you don't need to put password everytime you ssh to the remote server you want to access 

    or on the remote server, find '~/.ssh/authorized_keys' and add public key using vim, nano etc
